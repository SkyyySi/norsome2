# End-user libraries

The libraries here are intended to be used to be directly used by users editing their configs. They are usually rather simple and are often wrappers for more complex backend libraries. Instead of doing 99.9% of what a user could want, they are supposed to be simple and straight forward. However, they can also be wrappers adding new functionality on top. An example for the latter would be the build-in [`awful.popup`](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/popups_and_bars/awful.popup.html) library.

For simpler libraries that are intended to be directly used, please have a look at the [end-user libraries](modules/libraries/end-user) instead.

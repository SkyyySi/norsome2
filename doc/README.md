# Documentation style guide

> ### Note(s):
> - For the sake of simplicity, this document will refer to "documents in this repository" as simply "documents". All statements about documents (and how they should be) are only reffering to the documents here, not anywhere else.
> - It is HIGHLY recommended that you also read the markdown for some documents, as you will likely find it easier to understand by just looking at a few than by only trying to understand an "abstract" description of the formatting (which is what this document is about). But that does not mean that you shouldn't read this document. Just do both.

Documentaion should be simple and consise, but still tell you all there is to know about it's topic unless that information is better suited elsewhere. In order to make the documents in this repository as helpful as possible, they should all follow a common style in order to make sure that, once you understand the formatting for one file, you can jump into any and easily understand it.

<br />

## General

In general, you should try to use markup syntax rather than HTML syntax.
Besides that:

 - use Atx-style headers instead of Setext-style headers:

```Markdown
# This is a title
```

<br />

## Structure

> ### Note(s):
> - If an entry in the list below is formatted as "some thing": `some markup`, it means that it is a guideline on how you should format your documents.

Generally, a document should be structured like this:

 - top header (h1):
 
 ```Markdown
 # Title
 ```
 
 - if needed, a notes section: 
 
 ```Markdown
 > Note(s):
 > - This is a note.
 > - This, too, is a note.
 ```
 
 - a `---` seperator 
 - a license and copyright section (please use the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license if you want to contribute)

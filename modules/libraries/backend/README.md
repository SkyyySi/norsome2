# Backend libraries

The libraries here are intended to be used to perform background tasks, such as providing utility functions. These libraries are often "overkill" for common tasks as they are suppoesed to account for (pretty much) all usecases they could have. For simpler libraries that are intended to be directly used, please have a look at the [end-user libraries](modules/libraries/end-user) instead.
